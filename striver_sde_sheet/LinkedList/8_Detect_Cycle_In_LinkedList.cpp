/*
Problem Statement: Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
 Head = [1,2,3,4]
Output:
 true
Explanation: Here, we can see that we can reach node at position 1 again by following the next pointer. Thus, we return true for this case.

// Using Hashing
// Approach:

// We need to keep track of all the nodes we have visited till now so that once we
// visit the same node again we can say that a cycle is detected.
// The process is as follows:

// Use a hash table for storing nodes.
// Start iterating through the lists.
// If the current node is present in the hash table already,
// this indicates the cycle is present in the linked list and returns true.
// Else move insert the node in the hash table and move ahead.
// If we reach the end of the list, which is NULL, then we can say that
// the given list does not have a cycle in it and hence we return false.

// Using slow and faster pointer
// Approach:

// We will use two pointers with different steps forward. The process is as follows:-

// We will take two pointers, namely fast and slow. Fast pointer takes 2 steps ahead and slow pointer takes 2 points ahead.
// Iterate through the list until the fast pointer is equal to NULL. This is because NULL indicates that there is no cycle present in the given list.
// Cycle can be detected when fast and slow pointers collide.
