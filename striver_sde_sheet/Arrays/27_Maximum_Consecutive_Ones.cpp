/*
Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}

Output: 3

Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array.

// Time Complexity: O(N) since the solution involves only a single pass.

// Space Complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used.
