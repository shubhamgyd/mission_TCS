/*
Implement an application manager to handle three commands given as strings

1. "open x: Open application x.

2. Close k? Close the most recently opened applications. If there are or fewer applications open, close them all.

3. "clear": Close all open applications.

Given an array of commands, return the list of open applications after execution. The ids should be in the order they were opened.

Example

commands = ["open firefox", "open terminal", "open curl", "close 2", "open ps"]
