Debugging (find min in the array)
Given a string s, find the minimum number of substrings you can create without having the same letters repeating in each substring.
E.g world -> 1, as the string has no letters that occur more than once.
dddd -> 4, as you can only create substring of each character.
abba -> 2, as you can make substrings of ab, ba.
cycle-> 2, you can create substrings of (cy, cle) or (c, ycle)
