/*
You are given a bag of size W kg and you are provided costs of packets different weights of 
oranges in array cost[] where cost[i] is basically the cost of ‘i’ kg packet of oranges. 
Where cost[i] = -1 means that ‘i’ kg packet of orange is unavailable
Find the minimum total cost to buy exactly W kg oranges and if it is not possible to buy 
exactly W kg oranges then print -1. It may be assumed that there is an infinite supply of 
all available packet types.
Note: array starts from index 1.
